Hey hi this is Vinayak Patil
Here I uploaded experiment of subject Compiler Design.
All experiments code are not written by me. Few of them by me , few by me & my group members, few code or part of code or logic of program taken from internet which may be written by someone.
In each experiment there is image, which tell you how to execute program & what input should be given.
These experiments are written in different languages such as java, c, cpp, python, lex, yacc.
